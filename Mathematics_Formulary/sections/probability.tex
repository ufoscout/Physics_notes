\section{Binomial coefficients}
\begin{multicols}{3}
	
	\[ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \]
	
	\[ \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k} \]
	
	\[ \binom{n}{k} + \binom{n}{k-1} = \binom{n+1}{k} \]
	
	\[ \binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1 \]
	
	\[ \binom{n}{1} = \binom{n}{n-1} = n \]
	
	\[ (a+b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}a^kb^{n-k} \]
	
	\[ \sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k} = 2^n \]
	
	\[ \sum_{k=0}^{n}\sum_{h=0}^{k}\binom{n}{k}\binom{k}{h} = 3^n \]
	
	\[ \sum_{k=0}^{n}\sum_{h=0}^{k}\sum_{i=0}^{h}\binom{n}{k}\binom{k}{h}\binom{h}{i} = 4^n \]

\section{Permutations}
\textbf{Permutation}: set of ordered things (e.g. $(1,2,3)\ne(3,2,1)$).
Example of permutation: "How many ways can we award a 1st, 2nd and 3rd place prize among eight contestants?"

The number of {\it permutations} of $n$ elements is given by $$n!$$

The number of {\it permutations} of $p$ from $n$ is given by
\[
\frac{n!}{(n-p)!}=p!{n\choose p}
\]

The number of {\it permutations} of $p$ from $n$ with repetition is given by
\[
n^p
\]

\section{Combinations}
\textbf{Combination}: set of things whose order is not important (e.g. $(1,2,3)=(3,2,1)$).
Example of combination: "How many ways can I give 3 tin cans to 8 people?"

The number of possible {\it combinations} of $k$ elements from $n$ elements is given by
\[
{n\choose k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

The number of possible {\it combinations} of $k$ elements from $n$ elements with repetition is given by
\[
{n+(k-1)\choose k}={n+(k-1)\choose n-1}=\frac{(n+(k-1))!}{k!(n-1)!}
\]

The number of different ways to classify $n_i$ elements in $i$ groups, when
the total number of elements is $N$, is
\[
\frac{N!}{\prod\limits_i n_i!}
\]
